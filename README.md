# LineAL
This GitHub repository contains the source code for the 'LineAL' App, which provides functionality to perform operations on matrices. The app is built using Flutter and can perform various matrix operations, including addition, multiplication, finding the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of a matrix, etc.

# Why?
In the second semester, I took the SM-102-Mathematics-2 course, which is linear algebra. The course involved a lot of calculations with matrices, which were tedious, boring, and repetitive. To focus on actually solving the problems rather than doing these mundane calculations, which frustrated me, I decided to build a tool that would help me perform the operations. Since it would be more convenient to have this tool as an application rather than accessing a website that requires a stable internet connection, I decided to create an application.

# What operations can you perform using the app?
The following is a list of operations you can currently perform on the app. Many more operations will be added soon. 
1. Addition of two matrices.
2. Subtraction of two matrices.
3. Multiplication of two matrices.
4. Scalar multiplication of a matrix.
5. Transpose of a matrix.
6. Co-Factor matrix of a matrix.
7. Adjoint of a matrix.
8. Determinant of a matrix.
9. Row reduced echelon form(RREF) of a matrix.
10. Rank of a matrix.
11. Checking the linear independence or dependence of given vectors.
12. Basis of row space.
13. Basis of column space.
14. Basis of null space.
